This technology is one of the core elements in the BMW iX5 Hydrogen and generates a high continuous output of 125 kW/170 hp.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A chemical reaction takes place in the fuel cell between gaseous hydrogen from the tanks and oxygen from the air. Maintaining a steady supply of both elements to the fuel cell&#39;s membrane is of crucial importance for the drive system&#39;s efficiency. In addition to the technological equivalents of features found on combustion engines, such as charge air coolers, air filters, control units and sensors, the BMW Group also developed special hydrogen components for its new fuel cell system. These include the high-speed compressor with turbine and high-voltage coolant pump, for instance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nBMW iX5 Hydrogen Concept (2023)<br />\r\n2023 BMW iX5 Hydrogen Concept<br />\r\nThe BMW Group sources the individual fuel cells from the Toyota Motor Corporation. The two companies have enjoyed a partnership characterised by trust for many years and have been collaborating on fuel cell drive systems since 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fuel cell systems are manufactured in two main steps, based on the individual fuel cells. The cells are first assembled into a fuel cell stack. The next step involves fitting all the other components to produce a complete fuel cell system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stacking of the fuel cells is largely a fully automated process. Once the individual components have been inspected for any damage, the stack is compressed by machine with a force of five tonnes and placed in a housing. The stack housing is manufactured in the light metal foundry at BMW Group Plant Landshut using a sand casting technique.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For this, molten aluminium is poured into a mould made from compacted sand mixed with resin in a process specially designed for this small-series vehicle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The pressure plate, which delivers hydrogen and oxygen to the fuel cell stack, is made from cast plastic parts and light-alloy castings, also from the Landshut plant. The pressure plate forms a gas-tight and water-tight seal around the stack housing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Final assembly of the fuel cell stacks includes a voltage test along with extensive testing of the chemical reaction within the cells. Finally, all the different components are fitted together in the assembly area to produce the complete system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During this system assembly stage, further components are fitted, such as the compressor, the anode and cathode of the fuel-cell system, the high-voltage coolant pump and the wiring harness.</p>', '1706553069_BMW-iX5_-1.jpg', '[\"1706553069_at.BMW-iX5_-2.jpg\",\"1706553069_at.BMW-iX5_-3.jpg\",\"1706553069_at.BMW-iX5_-5.jpg\",\"1706553069_at.BMW-iX5_t-4.jpg\"]', '2024-01-29 18:31:09', '2024-01-29 18:31:09', 1),

With standard Subaru Symmetrical All-Wheel Drive and EyeSight&reg; Driver Assist Technology as well as available tablet-style high-definition 11.6-inch SUBARU STARLINK&trade; multimedia screen, DriverFocus&trade; Distraction Mitigation System and new XT models with 260 horsepower, the 2020 Legacy offers greater technology, performance, safety and refinement than ever before.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Built on the Subaru Global Platform, which offers increased safety, dynamics and quietness not to mention reduced noise, vibration and harshness (NVH), the Subaru Legacy will be available in Base, Premium, Sport, Limited, Limited XT and Touring XT models when it goes on sale at Subaru retailers this fall. New XT designations mark the return of a turbocharged engine to the Legacy lineup, thanks to a 260-horsepower 2.4-liter direct-injection SUBARU BOXER&reg; engine, while other models sport an enhanced 182-horsepower 2.5-liter direct-injection BOXER engine. Every 2020 Legacy features a Lineartronic&reg; Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT), auto stop/start and Subaru Symmetrical All-Wheel Drive with Active Torque Vectoring.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>STOUT STRUCTURE AND SAFETY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Introduced for 2017, the Subaru Global Platform has been optimized for the midsize Subaru Legacy, boasting a structure that is 70-percent stiffer in both torsional and front-suspension rigidity and 100-percent stiffer in both front lateral flexural and rear subframe rigidity compared to the previous Legacy&#39;s platform. Notable contributors to the increased stiffness include a 13-percent jump in ultra-high-tensile-strength steel, a 371-percent increase in structural adhesive (compared to initial iteration of the Subaru Global Platform) and, for the first time in a Subaru, a floor crossmember that is filled with a highly rigid and lightweight two-part foam material. In another Subaru first, the Legacy utilizes a full inner frame construction in which only the outer panels are welded to the structure after the entire body framework is assembled, unlike a conventional manufacturing process in which the upper and under bodies are assembled separately and then joined. This new inner frame construction is significantly stiffer and lighter than the previous Subaru Legacy&#39;s conventional structure.</p>', '1706554674_Subaru-Legacy-1.jpg', '[\"1706554674_at.Subaru-Legacy-2.jpg\",\"1706554674_at.Subaru-Legacy-3.jpg\",\"1706554674_at.Subaru-Legacy-4.jpg\"]', '2024-01-29 18:57:54', '2024-01-29 18:57:54', 1),

Everyone, it seems, has a Corolla story. Many, though, are going to be doing double takes when they see the re-imagined and reconfigured 2020 Toyota Corolla sedan. And that&#39;s exactly the point.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 12th-generation Toyota Corolla made its arrival in three chapters: the all-new Corolla hatchback arrived last summer, and then came the current best-selling Toyota Corolla body style, the sedan, in two waves - a reveal of the new gas model in Carmel and then the introduction of the U.S.&#39; first Corolla Hybrid at the Los Angeles Auto Show. All three are based on the Toyota New Global Architecture (TNGA), which is far more than a new body structure, bringing together new approaches to engineering, design, assembly, and materials. Now, there really is a Corolla for everyone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TNGA transforms Toyota Corolla styles into drivers&#39; delights while also bolstering the model&#39;s renowned value and reliability. They draw from the same DNA. It&#39;s no surprise, then, that the 2020 Corolla sedan dramatically elevates this model&#39;s focus on comfort and refinement while also infusing it with the Corolla hatchback&#39;s feisty personality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Toyota Corolla sedan&#39;s bold new look is a perfect reflection of the bumper-to-bumper, wheels-to-roof transformation that has taken place. The TNGA platform means an available engine that produces more power than its predecessor yet delivers better fuel efficiency. TNGA imbues the Corolla sedan with greater agility, yet also with its smoothest, quietest ride. TNGA also means an elevated feeling of quality in every surface, switch and control the driver sees and touches.

The vision was to take technical knowledge and experience from the highest level of international competition and apply them to a new road car that is also suitable for competition driving, and an affordable proposition for customers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For Toyota President Akio Toyoda, the creation of a sports car made purely by Toyota - the first in 20 years - was a personal ambition. Following on from winning the WRC manufacturers&#39; championship in 2018, he saw a winning car as being key to achieving global recognition as a true auto manufacturer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The GR Yaris is that car, built from scratch and designed to win at highest levels. It is Toyota&#39;s second global GR model, following the successful launch of the GR Supra in 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There were basic challenges to be met in terms of technical know-how and creating a car that customers would buy. From the outset, the development team worked closely with Tommi M&auml;kinen Racing to better understand how their goals could be achieved. It was a detailed and labour-intensive process, but one which has yielded strong results in terms of a car that has an ideal combination of rigid, lightweight construction, an agile and responsive chassis and a powerful yet compact turbo engine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Professional rally drivers, including members of TOYOTA GAZOO Racing World Rally Team, drove the prototype models and provided valuable feedback.
